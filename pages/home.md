  Our Neuroscience program teaches students to explore neural and brain function
  at multiple levels in a rapidly growing field. Our students study the neural
  basis of addiction, developmental disorders, ADHD, depression, anxiety and
  age-related disorders, and much more. Our program enables students to pursue a
  curriculum in several departments, colleges and schools at Temple. It
  encompasses a broad domain that ranges from molecular genetics and neural
  development, to brain processes involved in cognition and emotion, to
  mechanisms and consequences of neurodegenerative disease.
