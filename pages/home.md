  Neuroscience is an interdisciplinary field addressing neural and brain
  function at multiple levels. Our program enables students to pursue a
  curriculum in several departments, colleges and schools at Temple.It
  encompasses a broad domain that ranges from molecular genetics and neural
  development, to brain processes involved in cognition and emotion, to
  mechanisms and consequences of        neurodegenerative disease. The field
  also includes mathematical and physical principles involved in modeling neural
  systems and in brain  imaging.
