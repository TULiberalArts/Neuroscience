Templeâ€™s Neuroscience program teaches students to explore neural and brain function at multiple levels in a rapidly growing field. Our students study the neural basis of addiction, developmental disorders, ADHD, depression, anxiety and age-related disorders, among other fields. Our interdisciplinary curriculum allows students to take coursework in multiple departments at Temple, while engaging in the study of one of the most  dynamic areas of science.
