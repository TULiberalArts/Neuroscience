One of the major goals of the neuroscience program is to provide students with the research experience and practical training in neuroscience through faculty-mentored research. Neuroscience faculty at Temple University utilize state-of-the art equipment and cutting-edge techniques to study fundamental brain processes and functions at various levels and how this knowledge could be applied to the treatment of various neuropathologies. The program consists of more than 35 faculty members from different departments and colleges that provide mentorship to the undergraduate or graduate students. The research conducted by neuroscience participating faculty is funded by the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, Industry, and many private research foundations.

## Undergraduate Students

### Independent Study

Neuroscience majors are encouraged to gain first-hand experience with research through independent study. Students will carry out supervised neuroscience research by observing and participating in ongoing research in a laboratory environment.

The program requires the student to spend 3-4 hours per credit per week of a 14-week semester in the lab - 1 credit equals 3-4 hours per week, 2 credits equal 6-8 hours, 3 credits 9–12 hours, etc. Students may take a total of eight independent study credits and no more than four per semester. Independent study programs are offered in the fall, spring and both summer semesters. Any students who have a double major have the opportunity to complete two separate independent studies.

### Finding a Lab

Independent study is available in the laboratories of neuroscience faculty members at Temple. Independent study is very popular and students should start the process of finding a lab well in advance.

In most cases, students start a year in advance. Once a lab has been identified as an area of interest, the student must contact that research faculty member to see about openings, requirements, start dates, etc. Each laboratory program is unique and has different academic requirements. Some students will be required to complete a final paper, some students will be responsible for a literature search and all students are encouraged to submit a poster for the spring or fall poster session.

### Registering for Independent Study

In order to register for independent study, you need a Special Course Approval form. This form can be found in the Neuroscience Advising office in room 638 Weiss Hall.

Students must complete all information on the form and have the research mentor sign the form. The form should then be returned to the Neuroscience Advising office in room 638 Weiss. The form can be left under the door if there is no one available to help you. Once you are registered, you will notice that Dr. Parikh is the instructor. Dr. Parikh is responsible for the administration of the course. You will go to you laboratory and work with your mentor according to your agreement. At the end of the semester, your mentor will be contacted for a grade.

## Master's Research Project

Students are required to work on a master’s project for both semesters in the second year. Those students who are motivated to join doctoral programs or are interested in research positions will have the opportunity to work independently on a neuroscientific investigation under the supervision of a faculty member that maintains an active neuroscience research program. The purpose of the project will be to not only train students in specific neuroscientific techniques, but also to train students to develop scientific and analytical approach towards a problem, formulate clear research questions, conduct experiment, and analyze/interpret data.
