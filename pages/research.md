One of the neuroscience degree program’s major goals is providing undergraduate students and masters students with research experience and practical training in neuroscience through [faculty-mentored research](#independent-study). Temple University’s neuroscience faculty utilize state-of-the-art equipment and cutting-edge techniques to study fundamental brain processes and functions at various levels and to discover how this knowledge could be applied to treating various neuropathologies.

The program consists of more than 35 faculty members from different departments and colleges who provide mentorship to undergraduate and graduate students. The research is funded by the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health and Industry, and many private research foundations.

## Undergraduate Students

### BRIDGE Program
The Building Research Independence by Developing Goals and hands-on Experiences (BRIDGE) program is designed to give Temple undergraduate students from populations underrepresented in psychology and neuroscience paid summer research experience, individualized mentoring, and professional development opportunities. The summer training will allow for students to determine if they’re interested in research and provide them with experiential learning and skill development that will translate into a variety of post graduation opportunities. Networking opportunities and career development workshops will increase the likelihood students get the job or postgraduate training that they desire.

### Independent Study
Neuroscience majors are encouraged to gain first-hand experience with research through independent study. Students will carry out supervised neuroscience research by observing and participating in ongoing research in a laboratory environment.

The program requires the student to spend 3-4 hours per credit per week of a 14-week semester in the lab - 1 credit equals 3-4 hours per week, 2 credits equal 6-8 hours, 3 credits 9–12 hours, etc. Students may take a total of eight independent study credits and no more than four per semester. Independent study programs are offered in the fall, spring and both summer semesters. Any students who have a double major have the opportunity to complete two separate independent studies.

### Finding a Lab
Independent study is available in the laboratories of neuroscience faculty members at Temple. Independent study is very popular and students should start the process of finding a lab well in advance.

In most cases, students start a year in advance. Once a lab has been identified as an area of interest, the student must contact that research faculty member to see about openings, requirements, start dates, etc. Each laboratory program is unique and has different academic requirements. Some students will be required to complete a final paper, some students will be responsible for a literature search and all students are encouraged to submit a poster for the spring or fall poster session.

### Registering for Independent Study
In order to register for Independent Study, you will need to complete a Special Course Approval form. This form can be found in the Neuroscience Coordinator’s office in room 618 Weiss Hall.

Students must complete all information on the form and have the research mentor sign the form. The form should then be returned to the Neuroscience Coordinator’s office in room 618 Weiss Hall. Once you are registered, you will notice that Dr. Parikh is the instructor. Dr. Parikh is responsible for the administration of the course. You will go to you laboratory and work with your mentor according to your agreement. At the end of the semester, your mentor will be contacted for a grade. 

For any questions, please reach out to [Rebecca Brotschul](mailto:Rebecca.Brotschul@temple.edu). 

## Master's Research Project
Students are required to work on a master’s project for both semesters in the second year. Those students who are motivated to join doctoral programs or are interested in research positions will have the opportunity to work independently on a neuroscientific investigation under the supervision of a faculty member that maintains an active neuroscience research program. The purpose of the project will be to not only train students in specific neuroscientific techniques, but also to train students to develop scientific and analytical approach towards a problem, formulate clear research questions, conduct experiment, and analyze/interpret data.
