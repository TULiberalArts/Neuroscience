## Careers

Neuroscience is the study of the body’s nerve systems and how they affect human behavior. This multidisciplinary major can be designed to meet your specific area of interest. Course selections include cellular and molecular neuroscience, neurobiology, cell structure and function, cognitive neuroscience, chemistry, research opportunity and electives so you can target your interests. Students develop the background for a diverse range of graduate studies and professional programs in the life sciences.

Students graduating with a major (BS) in neuroscience from Temple University will be well prepared for a variety of graduate (MS/PhD) education programs in neuroscience and related fields. Neuroscience majors from Temple University will also be highly competitive for admission to medical school or any other health professions school, such as dental school or schools that prepare physical therapists or physician assistants. Given the broad impact of neuroscience, Temple University neuroscience majors will be increasingly sought out by leaders in law, business, social sciences, arts and humanities for collaboration where knowledge of the brain sciences addresses public policy, professional practice, and a broad understanding of human behavior. Some occupations require graduate level training.
