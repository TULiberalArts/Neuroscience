## A Hands-On Approach

Neuroscience majors have the opportunity to gain first-hand research experience by observing and participating in ongoing studies on campus and at external research sites. Our students love working in our [wet lab](http://liberalarts.temple.edu/about-us/newsroom/neuroscience-and-psychology-undergrads-not-afraid-get-their-hands-dirty) specifically for undergraduates.

## Customized Plan Of Study

No matter what our students have planned for life after graduation — further graduate study in neuroscience, medical school or entering the workforce — our flexible curriculum allows time for classes outside of the major, so our students get the well-rounded academic experience needed for their next stop.

## Expert And Engaged Faculty

Classes are taught by full-time faculty with degrees in neuroscience and extensive teaching and research experience in the field. Our small class sizes allow students the opportunity to network with neuroscience experts and receive personal attention from faculty.

## BS in Neuroscience

A [major in neuroscience](http://bulletin.temple.edu/undergraduate/liberal-arts/neuroscience-systems-behavior-plasticity/bs-neuroscience-systems-behavior-plasticity/) enables students to pursue a curriculum in several departments, colleges and schools at Temple University in one of the most dynamic areas of science. Neuroscience is an interdisciplinary field addressing neural and brain function at multiple levels. It encompasses a broad domain that ranges from molecular genetics and neural development, to brain processes involved in cognition and emotion, to mechanisms and consequences of neurodegenerative disease. The field of neuroscience also includes mathematical and physical principles involved in modeling neural systems and in brain imaging.

A number of departments throughout Temple include research and teaching in neuroscience, including departments in the Colleges of Engineering (CE), Health Professions (CHP), Liberal Arts (CLA), Science and Technology (CST), and the School of Medicine (TUSM). Neuroscience courses are open to students from any major.

## Minor in Neuroscience Research

The [minor in neuroscience research](http://bulletin.temple.edu/undergraduate/liberal-arts/neuroscience-systems-behavior-plasticity/minor-neuroscience-research/) expands opportunities for Temple students to get research experience and to become more competitive in their applications to graduate and professional schools. The required courses in the neuroscience research minor focus on basic neuroscience, cellular and molecular neuroscience, and neuroscientific techniques. Because of some overlap in coursework, the students must choose either the neuroscience research or the cognitive neuroscience minor.

## Minor in Cognitive Neuroscience

The [minor in cognitive neuroscience](http://bulletin.temple.edu/undergraduate/liberal-arts/psychology/minor-cognitive-neuroscience/) will strengthen the academic record of students who plan to apply for graduate programs. For example, in psychology this minor will strengthen applicants' records for specializations such as behavioral neuroscience, clinical neuropsychology, cognitive psychology or psychophysiology. Students might also go into general neuroscience or cognitive science. Pre-med students with a cognitive neuroscience minor present distinctive profiles to medical school admissions offices. Because of some overlap in coursework, the students must choose either the neuroscience research or the cognitive neuroscience minor.

## 4+1 Neuroscience 5-Year Master’s Program

### Program Description

The 4+1 master in neuroscience program offers outstanding Temple University neuroscience majors the opportunity to earn both the BS and MS in neuroscience in just 5 years. Admission to the program is highly selective. The program is designed to provide a research-intensive experience, advanced coursework and professional development to students who intend to pursue doctoral studies in any of the academic neuroscience disciplines.

Students apply to the program in the spring semester of the junior year after completing a minimum of 72 undergraduate credits. Additionally, students must have a faculty sponsor who has agreed to mentor the student’s master’s project research during the four-semester program.

The accelerated 4+1 MS degree program consists of a maximum of 113 semester hours of undergraduate coursework, a maximum of 10 semester hours of graduate coursework to count towards both the undergraduate and the graduate degrees, and an additional 20 semester hours of graduate coursework as a graduate student. Upon successful completion of the fourth year, students receive a BS in neuroscience (using 10 credits of graduate coursework) if they have met all other degree requirements. At the end of the contiguous fifth year, students receive a MS in neuroscience. 

### Admission Requirements

- Neuroscience GPA: 3.67
- Overall GPA: 3.67
- A mentorship agreement from the faculty sponsor

## Independent Study in Neuroscience
Students majoring in neuroscience are strongly encouraged to participate in research by taking courses in independent study as part of their elective credits for the major. Independent study opportunities will be offered in many of the laboratories of the more than 130 neuroscience faculty members in the various participating colleges and schools. The [Student Services Coordinator](mailto:smclaughlin@temple.edu) and [Program Director](mailto:vinay.parikh@temple.edu) will work with students to identify these independent study opportunities. More detailed information is available under [research](/neuroscience/research/#independent-study).

## Graduating with Distinction in Neuroscience

Majors in Neuroscience: Systems, Behavior, Plasticity have the opportunity to be awarded departmental distinction upon graduation. Graduating with distinction can be achieved by maintaining a grade point average 3.0 of better in all neuroscience courses, completing two semesters of independent study in Neuroscience (NSI 4182 & 4282) with an A- or better, and successfully completing a neuroscience research project based on the independent study work and described in a research paper and poster presented to neuroscience program faculty and students.  Students MUST complete an Application for Distinction.

### Distinction Paper 

The Distinction Paper should follow the _[Journal of Neuroscience](http://www.jneurosci.org/)_ format, and should be between eight and 15 pages long.

Distinction papers must be signed by the student’s Independent Study Mentor and then submitted to Dr. Parikh for approval, with a copy to the [Student Services Coordinator](mailto:mailto:smclaughlin@temple.edu).

### Poster Presentation

If you are submitting a poster for distinction, please be sure to indicate that in an email to the Student Services Coordinator prior to the presentation.  Distinction posters may be submitted for  the Spring poster sessions.

The neuroscience program will host a spring poster session each year, but students graduating prior to the spring semester and therefore presenting in the Fall must do so through an outside organization.

**Preparing Effective Posters**

- An effective poster is self-contained and self-explanatory. Viewers can proceed on their own while leaving the author free to discuss points raised in inquiry.
- The poster session offers a more intimate forum for discussion, but discussion becomes difficult if the author must explain the poster to a succession of viewers. Time spent at a poster presentation is determined by the viewer, not the author.
- An effective poster balances figures and texts and is not a page-by-page printout of a journal paper or a slide show.

**Planning and Layout**

Your poster should be approximately 36″ x 54″.  Avoid reflective, plastic-coated paper.

**Title**
- Prepare a banner for the top of the poster indicating the abstract title, author(s), affiliation(s), and the session number. Use lettering at least one-inch high.

**Illustrations**
- Design figures for viewing from a distance and use clear, visible graphics and large type. Colors are effective if used sparingly; use dark colors on white or pale backgrounds and light colors on dark backgrounds. Figures should illustrate no more than one or two major points.
- Simple figures are unnecessary. Make clear main points, but include detail for the aficionado. Indicate illustration sequences with numbers or letters at least one inch high. (Omit “Fig.” or “Figure” – this is unnecessary and occupies excess space).

**Text**
- Each figure or table should have a heading of one or two lines in very large type stating the “take-home” message. Provide additional essential information below in a legend set in 16 point or larger type

**Content**
- Minimize narrative.
- Integrate text that would normally appear in the body (Results and Discussion) of a manuscript in figure legends. Concisely describe not only the content of the figure, but also the derived conclusions.
- Place brief details of methodology at the end of each legend.
- Use large type in short, separated paragraphs with unjustified (ragged right) margins.
- Numbered or bulleted lists are effective ways to convey a series of points. Do not set entire paragraphs in uppercase (all capitals) or boldface type.
- Place an introduction at the upper left and a conclusion at the lower right, both in large type. It is rarely necessary to post a copy of the abstract.
