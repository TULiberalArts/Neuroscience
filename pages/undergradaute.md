Our program enables students to pursue a curriculum in several departments, colleges and schools at Temple. Neuroscience is an interdisciplinary field addressing neural and brain function at multiple levels. It encompasses a broad domain that ranges from molecular genetics and neural development, to brain processes involved in cognition and emotion, to mechanisms and consequences of neurodegenerative disease. The field also includes mathematical and physical principles involved in modeling neural systems and in brain imaging.

## A Hands-On Approach

Neuroscience majors have the opportunity to gain first-hand research experience by observing and participating in ongoing studies on campus, as well as at external research sites.  

## A Customized Plan Of Study

No matter what our students have planned for life after  graduation — further graduate study in neuroscience,  medical school or entering the workforce — our flexible  curriculum allows time for classes outside of the major, so our students get the well-rounded academic experience needed for their next stop after college.

## Expert And Engaged Faculty

Classes are taught by full-time faculty with degrees in  neuroscience and extensive teaching and research  experience in the field. Our small class sizes allow students the opportunity to network with neuroscience experts and receive personal attention from faculty.

## Academic offerings

- BS in Neuroscience
- Minor in Neuroscience Research
- MS in Neuroscience: Systems, Behavior and Plasticity
- PhD Specialization in Neuroscience

## Neuroscience Major

A major in Neuroscience enables students to pursue a curriculum in several departments, colleges, and schools at Temple University in one of the most dynamic areas of science. Neuroscience is an interdisciplinary field addressing neural and brain function at multiple levels. It encompasses a broad domain that ranges from molecular genetics and neural development, to brain processes involved in cognition and emotion, to mechanisms and consequences of neurodegenerative disease. The field of neuroscience also includes mathematical and physical principles involved in modeling neural systems and in brain imaging.

A number of departments throughout Temple University include research and teaching in neuroscience, including departments in the Colleges of Engineering (CE), Health Professions (CHP), Liberal Arts (CLA), Science and Technology (CST), and the School of Medicine (TUSM). Neuroscience courses are open to students with any major at Temple University.
