## MS in Neuroscience

Our [MS in Neuroscience: Systems, Behavior and Plasticity](http://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/scd/cla/neuroscience-systems-behavior-plasticity-ms/) provides highly advanced training and faculty-mentored research in a rapidly evolving field with practical applications in careers ranging from health care to public policy and economics.

This innovative program was developed by top faculty from the Departments of Psychology, Physical Therapy, and Kinesiology, to help qualified students gain core expertise in specific areas of neuroscience — including molecular, cellular, systems and behavioral neuroscience.

### Programs of Study

There are three areas of study in the master's program:

- Cognitive Neuroscience
- Behavioral Neuroscience
- Motor Neuroscience and Rehabilitation

### Master's Project

Students are required to work on a master’s project for both semesters in the second year. Depending upon their career goals, students may opt to engage either in a laboratory-based research project or in a non-laboratory project. Those students who are motivated to join doctoral programs or are interested in research positions will likely gain by working independently on a neuroscientific investigation under the supervision of a faculty member that maintains an active neuroscience research program. The purpose of the project will be to not only train students in specific neuroscientific techniques, but also to train students to develop scientific and analytical approach towards a problem, formulate clear research questions, conduct experiment, and analyze/interpret data.  

On the other hand, students who are not intending bench-level research upon graduation and are interested in non-research jobs (such as teaching, counseling, research administration, public policy etc.), may get engaged in a non-laboratory project of a similar scope. This may include activities such as conducting a literature review on a topic and presenting it to the audience, drafting a scope of work for a grant funding agency, or preparing a consulting proposal for a prospective client.

### Careers

Because the brain is involved in every important human endeavor, an understanding of the brain and its functions opens career paths in multiple fields including medicine, psychology, law, engineering, education and public policy. Master’s-level education in neuroscience will provide students with a wide range of career options including teacher/lecturer, research and teaching administrator, research associate at academic research institutes or private industries, biostatistician, medical or science writer, clinical data manager, public health administrator, environmental health safety officer, counselor, regulatory affairs specialist, and public policy strategist.
 
### Admission Requirements

All MS applicants must meet the requirements for admission listed below. The application deadline was **May 1, 2017**.

Admission to the MS program requires a bachelor's degree (BS or BA) in one of the following disciplines:
- Bioengineering
- Biology
- Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics
- Human Movement Science
- Kinesiology
- Neuroscience
- Psychology
- Public Health

Other relevant disciplines, combined with or including course work in biology, chemistry, mathematics/statistics, neuroscience, physics, and/or psychology may be accepted after an individual evaluation of the applicant's qualifications.

**Undergraduate GPA**: Temple University's Graduate School requires a minimum grade point average of 3.2 in undergraduate work for unconditional admission to the program.

**Letters of recommendation**: Three Letters of recommendation should be obtained from college/university faculty who are familiar with applicant’s academic abilities.

**Standardized Test Scores**: The GRE is not required. International students are required to submit a TOEFL score (minimum score of 88 iBT or 575 PBT).

[International applicants](http://www.temple.edu/grad/admissions/international.htm) should ensure that they meet the requirements for degree equivalency.

All completed applications are reviewed. If you do not meet one or more of the admission requirements (e.g., lacking a lab course; a GRE score below the minimum) your application, if complete, will be reviewed. 

### Application Instructions

1. Complete the initial application to the Graduate School at Temple.<br>
a. Visit http://www.temple.edu/apply/common/appcheck.asp and follow the directions to apply online.<br>
b. After filling in your personal information you will be asked to select a program. Select “Neuroscience/MS”<br>
c. Complete the application, submit, and pay electronically. Print out a copy of the application for your files.<br>

2. Return to this page to prepare additional application materials.<br>
a. Download and complete the two page [Neuroscience Master's Data Sheet](http://www.cla.temple.edu/neuroscience/files/2017/04/Temple-Neuroscience-Masters-Program-Application-1.pdf) that is required to accompany the Temple University Application for Graduate Study.<br>
b. Please prepare a resumé (also called a CV in academic circles).<br>
c. Have available the Statement of Goals from your on-line application.

3. Submitting additional materials for your application. <br>
a. Request three confidential letters of recommendation from college/university faculty who are familiar with your academic abilities. _Please note that if evaluators send letters directly to the [Student Services Specialist](mailto:smclaughlin@temple.edu) electronically, this replaces the stipulation on the graduate school application instructions that paper reference reports for Neuroscience MS applicants should be returned sealed to the applicant, who will then forward them with all other application materials in one complete package to the department. If letters of references are sent electronically by the evaluator, you DO NOT need to have paper copies of the letters mailed to you or send them via postal mail to the department.  You can ignore instructions, including those on the Temple University Graduate School site, that say otherwise.  All we need are letters sent directly to the Graduate Coordinator.  In addition, we do not have any other forms for your letter writers to fill out.  All we require is a letter.  There is no summary rating or evaluation form._ <br>
b. Have your official transcripts sent to Temple University Neuroscience Program. Request that transcripts from all your undergraduate institutions (including those from which you did not receive a degree) be sent to Temple University Neuroscience Program.  If you have completed graduate credits, transcripts from those institutions should also be sent to us. All official transcripts should be sent to the student services specialist, address located above.<br>
c.  In addition to the copies of your transcripts, please send electronic copies of the the following required application materials to the [Student Services Specialist](mailto:smclaughlin@temple.edu): the completed neuroscience master's data sheet, your statement of goals, and your CV. These documentsare separate from your Temple application, and must be submitted directly to the Graduate Coordinator if we are to receive them.<br>
d. Have your test scores sent to Temple. Have your English proficiency scores (if required) sent to Temple University electronically by ETS; the Temple University code is 2906. The Neuroscience MS program does not require the GRE for admission.

## PhD Specialization in Neuroscience

The Specialization in Neuroscience is for PhD students interested in studying neuroscience. It is open to any graduate student enrolled in a PhD program at Temple. Graduate students are admitted to the program after they have been accepted into a Temple PhD program. Upon successful completion of their departmental and neuroscience specialization requirements (see below), students receive a PhD degree in the discipline represented by their department with a specialization in neuroscience. To receive a Specialization in Neuroscience a student must fulfill the following requirements:

1.	Be a graduate student in good standing in a Temple University PhD program.

2.	Meet all the obligations of the student’s participating department.

3.	Have one member of the neuroscience program on their dissertation committee.

4.	Attend and participate in the Readings in Neuroscience (NSCI 9381), which is the Journal Club for the Neuroscience Seminar Series of the CLA Neuroscience program, for four semesters by enrolling for one credit each of four semesters.

5.	Take two courses in each of the Neuroscience Specialization Areas:
- Behavioral /Cognitive / Systems Neuroscience
- Cellular/Molecular Neuroscience
