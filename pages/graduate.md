## Program Overview

The M.S. in Neuroscience: Systems, Behavior and Plasticity provides highly advanced training and faculty-mentored research in a rapidly evolving field with practical applications in careers ranging from health
care to public policy and economics.

This innovative program was developed by Temple University’s Neuroscience faculty, consisting of top faculty from the Departments of Psychology, Physical Therapy, and Kinesiology, to help qualified students gain core expertise in specific areas of neuroscience — including molecular, cellular, systems and behavioral neuroscience.

In addition, our world-renowned faculty are committed to helping students develop professional competence in oral and written communication, as well as the analytical thinking and logic necessary to succeed in the
laboratory, the classroom and beyond.

Programs of Study

There are 3 areas of study in the Neuroscience Master's Program. They are:

- Cognitive Neuroscience
- Behavioral Neuroscience
- Motor Neuroscience and Rehabilitation
- For more information on our affiliated faculty's research in these three areas, please visit our [faculty page](http://www.cla.temple.edu/neuroscience/faculty-2/).

Total Credit Hours: 30

1 Students can take any elective relevant to their area of interest or specialization after approval from the program mentor.

## Master's Project:

Students are required to work on a Master’s project for both semesters in the second year. Depending upon their career goals, students may opt to get engaged either in a laboratory-based research project or in a non-laboratory project.  Those students who are motivated to join doctoral programs or are interested in research positions will likely gain by working independently on a neuroscientific investigation under the supervision of a faculty member that maintains an active neuroscience research program. The purpose of the project will be to not only train students in specific neuroscientific techniques but also to train students to develop scientific and analytical approach towards a problem, formulate clear research questions, conduct experiment, and analyze/interpret data.  On the other hand, students who are not intending bench-level research upon graduation and are  interested in non-research jobs (such as teaching, counseling, research administration, public policy etc.), may get engaged in a non-laboratory project of a similar scope. This may include activities such as conducting a literature review on a topic and presenting it to the audience, drafting a scope of work for a grant funding agency, preparing a consulting proposal for a prospective client.

## Careers

Because the brain is involved in every important human endeavor, understanding of brain and its functions opens career paths in multiple fields including medicine, psychology, law, engineering, education, and public policy.  Master’s-level education in neuroscience will provide students with a wide range of career options including teacher/lecturer, research and teaching administrator, research associate at academic research institutes or private industries, biostatistician, medical or science writer, clinical data manager, public health administrator, environmental health safety officer, counselor, regulatory affairs specialist, and public policy strategist.

## Admission Requirements

All M.S. applicants must meet the requirements for admission listed below. Application Deadline: April 15, 2017

Please visit our [Application Instructions](http://www.cla.temple.edu/neuroscience/ms-application/) page for more information on how to apply.

Coursework Required for Admission Consideration: Bachelor’s degree in Discipline/Related Discipline: Admission to the MS program will require a bachelor's degree (B.S. or B.A.) in one of the following disciplines:
- Bioengineering
- Biology
- Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics
- Human Movement Science
- Kinesiology
- Neuroscience
- Psychology
- Public Health

Other relevant disciplines, combined with or including course work in Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics/Statistics, Neuroscience, Physics, and/or Psychology may be accepted after an individual evaluation of the applicant's qualifications.

Undergraduate GPA: Temple University's Graduate School requires a minimum grade point average of 3.2 in undergraduate work for unconditional admission to the program.

Letters of recommendation: 3 Letters of recommendation should be obtained from college/university faculty who are familiar with applicant’s academic abilities.

Standardized Test Scores: The GRE is not required. International students are required to submit a TOEFL score (minimum score of 88 iBT or 575 PBT).

International applicants should consult the page at http://www.temple.edu/grad/admissions/international.htm to make sure that they meet the requirements for degree equivalency listed there.

All completed applications are reviewed. If you do not meet one or more of the admission requirements (e.g., lacking a lab course; a GRE score below the minimum) your application, if complete, will be reviewed. 

## Application Instructions

UPDATE: APPLICATIONS ARE NOW BEING ACCEPTED

THE APPLICATION DEADLINE IS APRIL 15, 2017

WE ONLY ACCEPT ONLINE APPLICATIONS. TO APPLY ONLINE, FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW.

PLEASE ALSO NOTE OUR ADMISSIONS REQUIREMENTS.

1. Complete the initial application to the Graduate School at Temple.
a. Visit http://www.temple.edu/apply/common/appcheck.asp and follow the directions to apply online.
b. After filling in your personal information you will be asked to select a program. Select “Neuroscience/MS”
c. Complete the application, submit, and pay electronically. Print out a copy of the application for your files.

2. Return to this page to prepare additional application materials.

3. Submitting additional materials for your application.
a. Request three confidential letters of recommendation from college/university faculty who are familiar with your academic abilities.

Please note that if evaluators send letters directly to the Student Services Specialist electronically, this replaces the stipulation on the graduate school application instructions that paper reference reports for Neuroscience M.S. applicants should be returned sealed to the applicant, who will then forward them with all other application materials in one complete package to the department. If letters of references are sent electronically by the evaluator, you DO NOT need to have paper copies of the letters mailed to you or send them via postal mail to the department.  You can ignore instructions, including those on the Temple University Graduate School site, that say otherwise.  All we need are letters sent directly to the Graduate Coordinator.  In addition, we do not have any other forms for your letter writers to fill out.  All we require is a letter.  There is no summary rating or evaluation form.

b. Have your official Transcripts Sent to Temple University Neuroscience Program. Request that transcripts from all your undergraduate institutions (including those from which you did not receive a degree) be sent to Temple University Neuroscience Program.  If you have completed graduate credits, transcripts from those institutions should also be sent to us. All official transcripts should be sent to the following address:

Student Services Specialist
Neuroscience Program
638 Weiss Hall
1701 North 13th Street
Philadelphia, PA 19122-6085

c.  In addition to the copies of your transcripts, please send electronic copies of the the following required application materials to the Student Services Specialist:
- The completed Neuroscience Master's Data Sheet
- Your Statement of Goals
- Your CV

The documents just listed are separate from your Temple application, and must be submitted directly to the Graduate Coordinator if we are to receive them.

4. Have your test scores sent to Temple.
