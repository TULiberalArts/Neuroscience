## MS in Neuroscience
Our MS in Neuroscience: Systems, Behavior and Plasticity provides highly advanced training and faculty-mentored research in a rapidly evolving field with practical applications in careers ranging from health care to public policy and economics.

This innovative program was developed by top faculty from the Departments of Psychology, Physical Therapy, and Kinesiology, to help qualified students gain core expertise in specific areas of neuroscience — including molecular, cellular, systems and behavioral neuroscience.

### Programs of Study
There are three areas of study in the master's program:

- Cognitive Neuroscience
- Behavioral Neuroscience
- Motor Neuroscience and Rehabilitation

## PhD Specialization in Neuroscience
The Specialization in Neuroscience is for PhD students interested in studying neuroscience. It is open to any graduate student enrolled in a PhD program at Temple. Graduate students are admitted to the program after they have been accepted into a Temple PhD program. Upon successful completion of their departmental and neuroscience specialization requirements (see below), students receive a PhD degree in the discipline represented by their department with a specialization in neuroscience. To receive a Specialization in Neuroscience a student must fulfill the following requirements:

- Be a graduate student in good standing in a Temple University PhD program.
- Meet all the obligations of the student’s participating department.
- Have one member of the neuroscience program on their dissertation committee.
- Attend and participate in the Readings in Neuroscience (NSCI 9381), which is the Journal Club for the Neuroscience Seminar Series of the CLA Neuroscience program, for four semesters by enrolling for one credit each of four semesters.
- Take two courses in each of the Neuroscience Specialization Areas:
  - Behavioral /Cognitive / Systems Neuroscience
  - Cellular/Molecular Neuroscience

## Master's Project
Students are required to work on a master’s project for both semesters in the second year. Depending upon their career goals, students may opt to engage either in a laboratory-based research project or in a non-laboratory project. Those students who are motivated to join doctoral programs or are interested in research positions will likely gain by working independently on a neuroscientific investigation under the supervision of a faculty member that maintains an active neuroscience research program. The purpose of the project will be to not only train students in specific neuroscientific techniques, but also to train students to develop scientific and analytical approach towards a problem, formulate clear research questions, conduct experiment, and analyze/interpret data.  

On the other hand, students who are not intending bench-level research upon graduation and are interested in non-research jobs (such as teaching, counseling, research administration, public policy etc.), may get engaged in a non-laboratory project of a similar scope. This may include activities such as conducting a literature review on a topic and presenting it to the audience, drafting a scope of work for a grant funding agency, or preparing a consulting proposal for a prospective client.

## Careers
Because the brain is involved in every important human endeavor, an understanding of the brain and its functions opens career paths in multiple fields including medicine, psychology, law, engineering, education and public policy. Master’s-level education in neuroscience will provide students with a wide range of career options including teacher/lecturer, research and teaching administrator, research associate at academic research institutes or private industries, biostatistician, medical or science writer, clinical data manager, public health administrator, environmental health safety officer, counselor, regulatory affairs specialist, and public policy strategist.
