## Academic Offerings at a Glance

- [MS in Neuroscience: Systems, Behavior and Plasticity](#ms-in-neuroscience)
- [PhD Specialization in Neuroscience](#phd-specialization-in-neuroscience)
- [4+1 Neuroscience 5-Year Master’s Program](/neuroscience/undergraduate/#program-description)

## MS in Neuroscience

Our [MS in Neuroscience: Systems, Behavior and Plasticity](http://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/scd/cla/neuroscience-systems-behavior-plasticity-ms/) provides highly advanced training and faculty-mentored research in a rapidly evolving field with practical applications in careers ranging from health care to public policy and economics.

This innovative program was developed by Temple University’s Neuroscience faculty, consisting of top faculty from the Departments of Psychology, Physical Therapy, and Kinesiology, to help qualified students gain core expertise in specific areas of neuroscience — including molecular, cellular, systems and behavioral neuroscience.

### Programs of Study

There are 3 areas of study in the Neuroscience Master's Program:

- Cognitive Neuroscience
- Behavioral Neuroscience
- Motor Neuroscience and Rehabilitation

**For more information on our affiliated faculty's research in these three areas, please visit our [faculty page](/neuroscience/faculty).**

### Master's Project

Students are required to work on a master’s project for both semesters in the second year. Depending upon their career goals, students may opt to get engaged either in a laboratory-based research project or in a non-laboratory project.  Those students who are motivated to join doctoral programs or are interested in research positions will likely gain by working independently on a neuroscientific investigation under the supervision of a faculty member that maintains an active neuroscience research program. The purpose of the project will be to not only train students in specific neuroscientific techniques but also to train students to develop scientific and analytical approach towards a problem, formulate clear research questions, conduct experiment, and analyze/interpret data.  

On the other hand, students who are not intending bench-level research upon graduation and are interested in non-research jobs (such as teaching, counseling, research administration, public policy etc.), may get engaged in a non-laboratory project of a similar scope. This may include activities such as conducting a literature review on a topic and presenting it to the audience, drafting a scope of work for a grant funding agency, or preparing a consulting proposal for a prospective client.

### Careers

Because the brain is involved in every important human endeavor, an understanding of the brain and its functions opens career paths in multiple fields including medicine, psychology, law, engineering, education and public policy.  Master’s-level education in neuroscience will provide students with a wide range of career options including teacher/lecturer, research and teaching administrator, research associate at academic research institutes or private industries, biostatistician, medical or science writer, clinical data manager, public health administrator, environmental health safety officer, counselor, regulatory affairs specialist, and public policy strategist.

### Admission Requirements

All MS applicants must meet the requirements for admission listed below. Application Deadline: **May 1, 2017**.

Admission to the MS program requires a bachelor's degree (B.S. or B.A.) in one of the following disciplines:
- Bioengineering
- Biology
- Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics
- Human Movement Science
- Kinesiology
- Neuroscience
- Psychology
- Public Health

Other relevant disciplines, combined with or including course work in Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics/Statistics, Neuroscience, Physics, and/or Psychology may be accepted after an individual evaluation of the applicant's qualifications.

Undergraduate GPA: Temple University's Graduate School requires a minimum grade point average of 3.2 in undergraduate work for unconditional admission to the program.

Letters of recommendation: 3 Letters of recommendation should be obtained from college/university faculty who are familiar with applicant’s academic abilities.

Standardized Test Scores: The GRE is not required. International students are required to submit a TOEFL score (minimum score of 88 iBT or 575 PBT).

International applicants should consult the page at [http://www.temple.edu/grad/admissions/international.htm](http://www.temple.edu/grad/admissions/international.htm) to make sure that they meet the requirements for degree equivalency listed there.

All completed applications are reviewed. If you do not meet one or more of the admission requirements (e.g., lacking a lab course; a GRE score below the minimum) your application, if complete, will be reviewed. 

### Application Instructions

UPDATE: APPLICATIONS ARE NOW BEING ACCEPTED

THE APPLICATION DEADLINE IS MAY 1, 2017

WE ONLY ACCEPT ONLINE APPLICATIONS. TO APPLY ONLINE, FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW.

a. Visit http://www.temple.edu/apply/common/appcheck.asp and follow the directions to apply online.<br>
b. After filling in your personal information you will be asked to select a program. Select “Neuroscience/MS”<br>
c. Complete the application, submit, and pay electronically. Print out a copy of the application for your files.<br>

2. Return to this page to prepare additional application materials.<br>
a. Download and complete the two page [Neuroscience Master's Data Sheet](http://www.cla.temple.edu/neuroscience/files/2017/04/Temple-Neuroscience-Masters-Program-Application-1.pdf) that is required to accompany the Temple University Application for Graduate Study.<br>

## Certificate in Neuroscience

Just recently approved, the Certificate in Neuroscience is for Ph.D. students interested in studying neuroscience in any department of the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Health Professions, College of Engineering, College of Science and Technology, and School of Medicine OTHER than Biology, Pharmacology, Physical Therapy, and Psychology, which for historical reasons are covered in the Specialization above. Upon successful completion of their departmental and Neuroscience Program requirements, students receive a Ph.D. degree in the discipline represented by their department with a Certificate in Neuroscience.

To receive a Certificate in Neuroscience a student must fulfill the following requirements:

1. Be a graduate student in good standing in a Temple University Ph.D. program.
2. Meet all the obligations of the student’s participating department.
3. Have one member of the Neuroscience Program on their dissertation committee.
4. Attend and participate in the Seminars/Journal Clubs of the Neuroscience Program for 4 semesters by enrolling for 1 credit each of 4 semesters.
5. Take two courses in each of the Neuroscience Specialization Areas:
- Behavioral /Cognitive / Systems Neuroscience
- Cellular/Molecular Neuroscience

## PhD Specialization in Neuroscience

In 1998 at Temple University, a university-wide interdisciplinary program in neuroscience was approved and funded by the Provost’s Office to facilitate multidisciplinary interactions among faculty interested in neuroscience and to provide a Specialization in Neuroscience both at the graduate and undergraduate levels. The graduate program continues to be active. A Neuroscience Seminar Series includes Temple University faculty alternating as presenters with neuroscience faculty members invited from other universities. To facilitate university-wide participation, lectures alternate between the main and health sciences campuses. Students read recent articles by each speaker and meet with the speaker for journal-club style discussions. This gives students the opportunity to meet neuroscientists at Temple and from throughout the country. The Neuroscience Specialization will be awarded to students in the following departments: Biology, Pharmacology, Physical Therapy, and Psychology.

### Graduate Specialization Overview

Graduate students are admitted to the Program after they have been accepted into a PhD program based on an interest to pursue their research in the neuroscience area. Any graduate student in a PhD program at Temple University can participate in the Neuroscience Program. Upon successful completion of their departmental and Neuroscience Program requirements, students receive a PhD degree in the discipline represented by their department with a Specialization in Neuroscience. To fulfill the requirements of the Program, students must **pass courses in 2 areas of neuroscience** as well as **participate in the Neuroscience Program’s Seminars and Journal Clubs for four semesters.**
