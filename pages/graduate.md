## Program Overview

The **M.S. in Neuroscience: Systems, Behavior and Plasticity** provides highly advanced training and faculty-mentored research in a rapidly evolving field with practical applications in careers ranging from health care to public policy and economics.

This innovative program was developed by Temple University’s Neuroscience faculty, consisting of top faculty from the Departments of Psychology, Physical Therapy, and Kinesiology, to help qualified students gain core expertise in specific areas of neuroscience — including molecular, cellular, systems and behavioral neuroscience.

## Academic Offerings

- [M.S. in Neuroscience: Systems, Behavior and Plasticity](http://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/scd/cla/neuroscience-systems-behavior-plasticity-ms/)

## Programs of Study

There are 3 areas of study in the Neuroscience Master's Program. They are:

- Cognitive Neuroscience
- Behavioral Neuroscience
- Motor Neuroscience and Rehabilitation

****For more information on our affiliated faculty's research in these three areas, please visit our [faculty page](http://www.cla.temple.edu/neuroscience/faculty-2/).

## Program requirements

Required Courses:

- PSY 8712: Neuroscience Core 3 cr.
- PSY 5003: Advanced Statistics 3 cr.
- NSCI 5016: Professional Development in Neuroscience 3 cr.
- NSCI 5001: Systems and Behavioral Neuroscience 3 cr.
- NSCI 5002: Neurochemistry 3 cr.

Total Credit Hours: 30

- Students can take any elective relevant to their area of interest or specialization after approval from the program mentor.

## Master's Project:

Students are required to work on a Master’s project for both semesters in the second year. Depending upon their career goals, students may opt to get engaged either in a laboratory-based research project or in a non-laboratory project.  Those students who are motivated to join doctoral programs or are interested in research positions will likely gain by working independently on a neuroscientific investigation under the supervision of a faculty member that maintains an active neuroscience research program. The purpose of the project will be to not only train students in specific neuroscientific techniques but also to train students to develop scientific and analytical approach towards a problem, formulate clear research questions, conduct experiment, and analyze/interpret data.  On the other hand, students who are not intending bench-level research upon graduation and are  interested in non-research jobs (such as teaching, counseling, research administration, public policy etc.), may get engaged in a non-laboratory project of a similar scope. This may include activities such as conducting a literature review on a topic and presenting it to the audience, drafting a scope of work for a grant funding agency, preparing a consulting proposal for a prospective client.

## Careers

Because the brain is involved in every important human endeavor, understanding of brain and its functions opens career paths in multiple fields including medicine, psychology, law, engineering, education, and public policy.  Master’s-level education in neuroscience will provide students with a wide range of career options including teacher/lecturer, research and teaching administrator, research associate at academic research institutes or private industries, biostatistician, medical or science writer, clinical data manager, public health administrator, environmental health safety officer, counselor, regulatory affairs specialist, and public policy strategist.

3. Submitting additional materials for your application.
a. Request three confidential letters of recommendation from college/university faculty who are familiar with your academic abilities.

Please note that if evaluators send letters directly to the Student Services Specialist electronically, this replaces the stipulation on the graduate school application instructions that paper reference reports for Neuroscience M.S. applicants should be returned sealed to the applicant, who will then forward them with all other application materials in one complete package to the department. If letters of references are sent electronically by the evaluator, you DO NOT need to have paper copies of the letters mailed to you or send them via postal mail to the department.  You can ignore instructions, including those on the Temple University Graduate School site, that say otherwise.  All we need are letters sent directly to the Graduate Coordinator.  In addition, we do not have any other forms for your letter writers to fill out.  All we require is a letter.  There is no summary rating or evaluation form.

b. Have your official Transcripts Sent to Temple University Neuroscience Program. Request that transcripts from all your undergraduate institutions (including those from which you did not receive a degree) be sent to Temple University Neuroscience Program.  If you have completed graduate credits, transcripts from those institutions should also be sent to us. All official transcripts should be sent to the following address:

Student Services Specialist
Neuroscience Program
638 Weiss Hall
1701 North 13th Street
Philadelphia, PA 19122-6085

c.  In addition to the copies of your transcripts, please send electronic copies of the the following required application materials to the Student Services Specialist:
- The completed Neuroscience Master's Data Sheet

## The Neuroscience Specialization

### Specialization Overview

In 1998 at Temple University, a university-wide interdisciplinary Program in Neuroscience was approved and funded by the Provost’s Office to facilitate multidisciplinary interactions among faculty interested in neuroscience and to provide a Specialization in Neuroscience both at the graduate and undergraduate levels. The graduate program continues to be active. A Neuroscience Seminar Series includes Temple University faculty alternating as presenters with neuroscience faculty members invited from other universities. To facilitate university-wide participation, lectures alternate between the main and health sciences campuses. Students read recent articles by each speaker and meet with the speaker for journal-club style discussions. This gives students the opportunity to meet neuroscientists at Temple and from throughout the country. The Neuroscience Specialization will be awarded to students in the following departments: Biology, Pharmacology, Physical Therapy, and Psychology.

Learn more about the [Neuroscience Specialization](http://www.cla.temple.edu/neuroscience/graduate-specialization/) admission and requirements, and contact the [Neuroscience Student Services Coordinator](Neuro@temple.edu) for application information.

### Certificate in Neuroscience

Just recently approved, the Certificate in Neuroscience is for Ph.D. students interested in studying neuroscience in any department of the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Health Professions, College of Engineering, College of Science and Technology, and School of Medicine OTHER than Biology, Pharmacology, Physical Therapy, and Psychology, which for historical reasons are covered in the Specialization above. Upon successful completion of their departmental and Neuroscience Program requirements, students receive a Ph.D. degree in the discipline represented by their department with a Certificate in Neuroscience.

To receive a Certificate in Neuroscience a student must fulfill the following requirements:

- Be a graduate student in good standing in a Temple University Ph.D. program.
- Meet all the obligations of the student's participating department.
- Have one member of the Neuroscience Program on their dissertation committee.
- Attend and participate in the Seminars/Journal Clubs of the Neuroscience Program for 4 semesters by enrolling for 1 credit each of 4 semesters.

Take two courses in each of the Neuroscience Specialization Areas:

- Behavioral /Cognitive / Systems Neuroscience
- Cellular/Molecular Neuroscience
