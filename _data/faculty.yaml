  bio: "Vinay Parikh, Ph.D. is an Associate Professor of Psychology and head of the Neurochemistry and Cognition Laboratory at Temple University. He is also the Director of Neuroscience Program in the College of Liberal Arts. Dr. Parikh’s research generally concerns neuromodulation of cognitive processes specifically those involved in attention and executive functions. A particular focus of his work is to delineate neurochemical signaling mechanisms that regulate functional interactions between the prefrontal cortex and other cortical and subcortical regions, and how alterations in discrete neurochemical circuits impact top-down cognitive control of behavior during the aging process and following chronic use of psychoactive drugs. Additionally, Dr. Parikh and his group are interested in exploring how the interplay of genes and environment influence the cognitive reserve capacity. Cognitive impairments constitute the core features of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and psychopathological states associated with drug addiction, schizophrenia and other mental disorders. The long term goal of his research is to identify potential biomarkers to develop psychotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of these cognitive and mental conditions. Dr. Parikh’s research involves the use of rodent models to examine cognitive alterations in the normative and pathological brain.  A broad range of neuroscientific methods and approaches are used in his research including the sophisticated operant behavioral paradigms, in vivo electrochemical recordings, vector-based genetic manipulations and protein biochemistry. Dr. Parikh has directed many research projects and his current research is funded by the National Institute of Health. Dr. Parikh received his Ph.D. in Life Sciences/Pharmacology from Punjabi University (India). After leading the Pharmacology group in Drug Discovery division at Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., he joined the Medical College of Georgia (Augusta, GA) as a postdoctoral fellow to obtain training in Neurochemistry  and Neuropsychopharmacology. He integrated perspectives of systems and behavioral/cognitive neuroscience into his research by acquiring further postdoctoral training in Psychobiology and Neuroscience from the Ohio State University (Columbus, OH) and the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, MI). Dr. Parikh is a faculty member of the Psychology Department at Temple University since 2009. He has published over 50 peer-reviewed articles and contributed many book chapters. He has also received several honors and awards including the Research Faculty Recognition Award from the University of Michigan (2008); New Investigator Award in Alzheimer’s disease from the American Federation for Aging Research (2010), and Young Investigator Awards from NARSAD (2010) and the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (2014)."

  bio: "Women are twice as likely as men to suffer from stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. As principle investigator of the Neuroendocrinology and Behavior Laboratory, Dr. Debra Bangasser uses techniques from biopsychology, neuroendocrinology, and cellular and molecular biology to investigate whether there are neurobiological factors that contribute to this disparity between men and women. Specifically, her research program explores sex differences in stress response systems that predispose females to stress and stress-related psychiatric disease. Dr. Bangasser has authored numerous publications in top journals including Nature Neuroscience and Molecular Psychiatry. She is a member of the American Psychological Association, International Behavioral Neuroscience Society, Organization for the Study of Sex Differences, Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology, and Society for Neuroscience.
